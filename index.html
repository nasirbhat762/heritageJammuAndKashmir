            <p>The rich heritage of Jammu & Kashmir is an important part of its tourism. The union territory boasts a
                number of massive forts, exquisite palaces, along with some impressive gardens and ancient temples and
                mosques as heritage sites for tourists to get an idea about the grandeur of architecture and history.
                Both Jammu and Kashmir regions enjoy different architecture styles, and thus, the two regions are quite
                interesting to visit on a heritage tour.</p>

                    <h3>Kud Dance</h3>
                    <p>One of the famous dance forms of the state is Kud dance. It is performed to honor the gods ‘Lok
                        Devtas’ as a thanks giving ritual and is mostly done in nights. This form has lots of
                        interesting and twisted movements. Unlike other dance forms in Kud dance young people as well
                        old people participate equally that makes it more interesting. Rhythm and Beats of the music
                        dominate in this form of dance forms and dancers plan their movement accordingly. Some special
                        Musical instruments are used in dance like Chhaina, Drums, Narsingha and flute. Spontaneity is
                        another key Feature that is found mostly in all the folk dances. This kind of dance is generally
                        performed in centre of mountains in and around Jammu and is mostly performed during rainy
                        season. The reason behind this is the farmers and villagers who work as farmers want to oblige
                        god the local deity ‘Gramdevta’ for protecting their cattle’s, maize crops, children’s and
                        family from all sorts of natural calamities. The local farmers perform this dance generally and
                        people join from nearby villages in the celebrations. Everyone is in their best attire and dance
                        through the night and celebrate in a festive spirit. In typical Kud dance, dancers are in 20 to
                        30 numbers which is performed by famers to thank god and is generally continued till late hours
